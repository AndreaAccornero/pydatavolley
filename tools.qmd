## Python

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSC) is used while Python examples are shown. Visual Studio Code is a text editor, like Notepad, but on steroids. It's a tool that helps programmers write and organize their code. There is a great [interactive tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py) if your interested in getting deep into it.

## R

[RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) is used while R examples are shown. RStudio desktop has a great interactive window which is easy to use and begin.

## DVW files

The data project scouting software, [data volley 4](https://www.dataproject.com/Products/EN/en/Volleyball/DataVolley4) produces .dvw files. These files are similar to a text file. If your interested in some example files, you can find them [here](https://mevza.volleynet.at/Download/59).

## Python - Reading a dvw file

The provided example file is used. You would typically fill in the `None` with the actual path of your dvw files.

```{python}
#| tbl-pyex: Example python reading data
from datavolley import read_dv
dv_instance = read_dv.DataVolley(None) # Replace `None` with path of your dvw file 
df = dv_instance.get_plays()
df = df.head(10)
print(df.to_markdown(tablefmt="grid"))
```

## R - Reading a dvw file

The provided example file is used. You would typically fill in the `None` with the actual path of your dvw files.

```{r}
#| warning: FALSE
library(datavolley)
x <- dv_read("datavolley//example_data.dvw") # Example data from python
px <- x$plays
px <- head(px, 10)
knitr::kable(px)
```
